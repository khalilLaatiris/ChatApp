# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine as builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
# Note: You might need to set environment variables here if your build depends on them
# Example: ARG REACT_APP_API_URL
# ENV REACT_APP_API_URL=$REACT_APP_API_URL
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:1.25-alpine

# Copy the build output from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx configuration if needed (optional)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
